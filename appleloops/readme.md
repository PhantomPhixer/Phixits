# Appleloops scripts #

in order to easily downlaod and maintain the required sound loops for Garageband and Logic pro most education establishments, and probably anyone else really, use [appleloops](https://github.com/carlashley/appleloops).

this is a command line app that works out which app(s) are installed and downlaods the appropriate files

## What's in here? ##
1.  A script to create a launchdaemon and script that will run and update the loops every startup
2.  An EA for jamf to record th eversion

## LaunchDaemon ##

This script needs little customisation to work. Full instructions are in the script.

## EA ##
Needs no customisation if the appleloops installer is used as it uses the default path


### anything else? ###
If you want a mechanism to create launchD and script from a policy then start with the one here :-)
